# ðŸ“˜ JS_Learning â€” JavaScript via Metanit

This is my personal learning repository where I study **JavaScript** step-by-step based on the [Metanit JavaScript Course](https://metanit.com/web/javascript/).  
The goal is not just to read theory but to **understand**, **practice**, and **document** everything with real code examples.
